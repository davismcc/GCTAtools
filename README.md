# GCTAtools
Python functions to help with the analysis of results from GCTA (http://www.complextraitgenomics.com/software/gcta/).

Specifically, these tools allow parsing of log files computed by GCTA to extract variance partitioning results. To these results, functions here can compute enrichment in variant categories as described by [Gusev et al (2014)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929714004261). 

If you find these tools useful, or find bugs or places for improvement, please let me know.
